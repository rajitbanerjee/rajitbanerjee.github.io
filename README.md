My portfolio website, built with TypeScript/React.js (Create React App).

## Getting Started

- For development:
  ```bash
  npm i
  npm start
  ```
- For production:

  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run analyze

  npm install -g serve # optional
  serve -s build
  ```

- Deployment to `gh-pages` branch:
  ```bash
  npm run deploy
  ```
  GitHub Pages requires configuration of source branch as `gh-pages`, and optionally a custom domain under repository `Settings > Pages`.
